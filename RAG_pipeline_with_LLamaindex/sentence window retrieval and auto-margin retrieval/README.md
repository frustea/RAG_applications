 Auto Merging Retriever, a simple yet powerful tool for information retrieval. It's designed to make searching within large documents more efficient. Here's how it works:

1-It breaks down a document into smaller parts or chunks.
2-When you search, it first finds the most relevant small chunks.
3-Then, it decides whether to show you the larger section that contains these chunks, based on how many relevant pieces it finds.
It's a handy tool for anyone looking to improve how they find and use information in large documents!
