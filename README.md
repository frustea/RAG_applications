Developed an advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using LLamaIndex for both foundational and sophisticated applications, benchmarked against TruEra. The project incorporated three innovative strategies: sentence window retrieval, auto-margin retrieval, and comprehensive evaluation metrics focused on answer relevance, groundlessness, and cortex relevance. This approach aimed at enhancing the precision and relevance of AI-generated responses, showcasing a significant step forward in the application of generative AI technologies.
